<!-- PURPOSE -->

<section class="main-content front" markdown="1">
<div style="height: 50px;"></div>

## Purpose
We are developing drone wind energy in order to create a future where renewable energy is the most cost effective option. Cheaper energy will help societies reduce the average amount of "hard" work required to sustain a given living standard, freeing up time for more valuable pursuits. We find the reflections in these answers quite interesting: [If energy was free](https://www.quora.com/If-energy-was-free-and-renewable-how-would-the-economy-be-fundamentally-different-from-what-it-is-now)

<!-- SOLUTION  -->

## Solution
We are building a new type of flying wind turbine that can make wind power accessible for many more locations, as well as significantly cheaper. It utilises drone technology to autonomously control a flying wing tethered to the ground, and this wing acts as the blade of a traditional wind turbine. Because it needs no tower, only a small foundation and uses its "blades" (the wings) much more efficiently, it only needs a fraction of the material of a conventional system, for the same power output. This is where costs are saved, and it is the reason it can be installed almost anywhere, without large cranes and other expensive infrastructure.

Our path towards commercially viable kite energy is designed with the philosophy of dealing with the most difficult problems first - a complete autonomous flight.
