# KiteX Project Overview
**Quick Status:** On September 13th we succeeded in creating a autonomous flying kite. [detailed description]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2016-09-13-AK002-first-self-flying-kite %}) **[Video clip](https://youtu.be/O_YaRTxpii8)**

## Why is Kite Energy interesting?
Traditional wind mills are often the preferred solutions when creating new power plants due their low price per watt and low environmental impact. **Using kites as a mean of capturing wind energy has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of energy, not just compared to other renewable sources.**

The energy that you can extract from the wind is broadly proportional to the **swept area** (the area that e.g. the wings of a wind turbine cover as they rotate). Using large kite tethered to the ground you can cover the same swept area as the wings of a traditional windmill using a significantly ligther support structre. The tether replaces most of the tower and foundation, as well as the inner part of the wing (which captures very little energy).

A kite is able to sweep a given area with a much smaller system than a traditional turbine. A tether to the ground can replaces most of the *previously* necessary support structure, the inner parts of the wings, the tower and foundation. Makani, the currently leading commercial kite energy project,  estimates that their kite system can deliver approximately **10 times the energy per weight** of a traditional wind turbine.

Two further advantages of the kite system is that it can more easily capture wind at higher altitudes where the wind is more consistent, delivering the rated output a higher degree of the time. This will become especially important as a larger portion of the locally generated energy is from "unreliable" sources. Since the bending moment on the foundation of a kite mill is small to non-existent it will be much easier to setup these kite system in offshore conditions.

From a technical perspective it would have been possible to make such a kite ever since the invention of the computer, but right now we are getting to a point in time where advances in materials and computer technology make it a viable and cheaper option.

## What is the purpose of KiteX
We would like to promote and carry out the development of kite technology in order to create a future with cheaper and only renewable energy. Cheaper energy will help societies reduce the average amount of "hard" work required to sustain a given living standard freeing up time to pursue more interesting exercises. We find the reflections in these answers quite interesting: [Quora - if energy was  free](https://www.quora.com/If-energy-was-free-and-renewable-how-would-the-economy-be-fundamentally-different-from-what-it-is-now)

In order to promote this future KiteX will be a project and company focusing on research and development of kite-systems and we will make sure to share all learnings we can, while still retaining necessary knowhow in-house in order to be a viable business.

## Who are We?

### Andreas Bruun Okholm
I have a mixed design, mechanical and aerospace degree from the Technical University of Denmark. Doing my master degree I created a smartphone based wind measuring tool, which provide value adding functionality to traditional wind meters and most importantly allows kite-surfers to share ultra local wind information. I worked on this project (Vaavud) for 3 years varying between hardware and software development. We managed to create the most sold smartphone wind meter and the first one to measure wind direction in the world.

I have for a long time been fascinated by the power of kites, and been using them for surfing for the past 10+ years. Being able to work with kites is really fascinating and I find that it allows me to use most of my toolset: mechanics, aerodynamics, programming, startups and most importantly it gives a feeling of making a positive impact.

Do you share the same vision for a the kite future? get in contact! :)

# What are the steps?
The plan towards kite energy is designed with the philosophy of dealing with the most difficult problems first - a complete autonomous self-starting and landing kite. Step 1, 2 are just progressions towards this. (subject to change).

1. Create an autonomous flying kite (DONE)
2. Create a tethered drone that can take off and land autonomously
3. Combine 1 and 2 into a completely autonomous kite
4. Add energy generation
5. Make it big

# Competing companies

While there currently is 100+ organizations involved in airborne wind energy [ref](http://energykitesystems.net/AWEstakeholders/index.html) in varying states, three companies really stand out as  
* Makani. Founded in 2006. Developing a hard wing with mounted generators and engines for control and power generation. Should be starting a trial with a 600 kW version in Hawaii very soon. Investment in 2006 and 2008 of a combined of 15 million USD [ref](http://www.itechpost.com/articles/9658/20130523/google-x-makani-power-make-traditional-wind-energy-obsolete.htm). [website](https://www.google.com/makani/). [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makani_Power).  
* Ampyx power. Founded in 2008. Developing a hard wing, sailplane line, kite with ground based generator. Total investment of at least 4.5 million euro [ref](https://www.ampyxpower.com/partners). [website](https://www.ampyxpower.com).
* SkySails. Founded in 2001. Developing a soft kite with ground based generator. Has experience from developing a 300 m2 kite for pulling cargo ships. Investment in research in kite related activities to date 50 million euros [ref](http://www.skysails.info/english/power/development/). [website](http://www.skysails.info/).
