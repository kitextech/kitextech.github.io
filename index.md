**Latest: Marts 20th**
Our first autonomous flight in positional hover control mode. Position commands are send from our ground control software running on the laptop. The kite is aware of the tether point and takes any position commands and translate it into movement on the sphere of possible locations. Additional thrust in the direction of the tether towards the kite is added to keep a constant tether tension.

## The future of wind energy
Traditional wind mills are often the preferred solutions when creating new power plants due their low price per watt and low environmental impact. **Using kites as a mean of capturing wind energy has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of energy, not just compared to other renewable sources.**

![Kite Energy Concept](/images/Dual Airbone Generators.png)

The amount of energy that you can extract from the wind is broadly proportional to the **swept area** (the area that e.g. the wings of a wind turbine cover as they rotate). Using a large kite tethered to the ground you can cover the same swept area as the wings of a traditional windmill using a significantly lighter support structure. The tether replaces most of the tower and foundation, as well as the inner parts of the wings (which capture very little energy).

> We estimate that our kite energy system can deliver the same power at approximately **one tenth of the weight** of a traditional wind turbine. This translates to much lower costs for installing and servicing the wind power station.

### Computing power

While kites have been used to harness the power of the wind for utilitarian purposes since ancient times (lifting men, pulling cargo etc) wind power stations using kites are only appearing now. This is due in large part to the fact that they, especially the most efficient variants, require relatively sophisticated computer control systems. The dramatic fall in the cost of computing power makes kite energy a much more viable approach than just a decade ago. Combined with recent strides in materials technology makes this a very exciting and rewarding time to develop kite energy.

### How it works

1. The kites takes off vertically like a quad-copter using their generators as motors to provide thrust.
2. The tether is unwound until the kites reaches operational altitude.
3. The kites start moving in around a common center of rotation using the airfoils of the main wing to propel the kite forward
4. Using the forward thrust provided by the primary airfoils the generators is activated and starts generating power
5. When the wind drops below the starting speed, the process is reversed and the kites land.

## Our Purpose
We will be promoting and developing kite technology in order to create a future where renewable energy is the most cost effective option. Cheaper energy will help societies reduce the average amount of "hard" work required to sustain a given living standard, freeing up time for more valuable pursuits. We find the reflections in these answers quite interesting: [Quora - if energy was free](https://www.quora.com/If-energy-was-free-and-renewable-how-would-the-economy-be-fundamentally-different-from-what-it-is-now)

In order to promote this future the company KiteX will be focusing on research and development of kite-systems and we will be disseminating our findings to the largest extent possible, while ensuring that viability of our own business.

### Andreas Bruun Okholm
I have a mixed design, mechanical and aerospace degree from the Technical University of Denmark and University of Adelaide. Doing my master degree I created a smartphone based wind measuring tool, which provide value adding functionality to traditional wind meters and most importantly allows kite-surfers (and other wind users) to share ultra local wind information. I worked on this project (called Vaavud) for 3 years doing both hardware and software development. We managed to create the most sold smartphone wind meter in the world -- and the first one to measure wind direction.

I have for a long time been fascinated by the power of kites, and been using them for surfing for the past 10+ years. Being able to work with kites is really fascinating and I find that it allows me to make use of most of my toolset: mechanical engineering, aerodynamics, programming, startups and most importantly it gives a feeling of making a positive impact.

### Gustaf Kugelberg

An avid kitesurfer since 8 years, my educational background is in pure and applied mathematics, with a touch of liberal arts -- I took a M. Sc. Eng. in technical physics, and studied mathematics, Archaeology, Greek, Latin, Russian and Japanese on the side.

I have worked as a management consultant at Oliver Wyman, helped launch a small but very successful compensation consultancy, advised startups in industries ranging from construction innovations to mineral prospecting and for the last 5 years I have also been developing software, most notably for Vaavud, mentioned above, and Realm.

## <a name="progress-link" class="anchor"></a>Progress
Our path towards commercially viable kite energy is designed with the philosophy of dealing with the most difficult problems first - a complete autonomous self-starting and landing kite. Steps 1 and 2 below are the progressions towards this. (subject to change).

1. Create an autonomously flying kite (**Achieved**)
2. Create a fixed wing flying kite (**Achieved**)
3. Create a tethered drone that can take off and land autonomously ((**Work in progress**)
4. Combine 2 and 3 into a completely autonomous kite
5. Add energy generation
6. Scale it up to commercially viable proportions

## Competitive landscape

While there are currently 100+ organisations involved in airborne wind energy [reference](http://energykitesystems.net/AWEstakeholders/index.html) in varying fields and stages, few have reached commercial viability. These three companies in particular stand out:

* Makani. Founded in 2006. Developing a hard wing with mounted generators and engines for control and power generation. Should be starting a trial with a 600 kW version in Hawaii very soon. Investment in 2006 and 2008 of a combined of 15 million USD [reference](http://www.itechpost.com/articles/9658/20130523/google-x-makani-power-make-traditional-wind-energy-obsolete.htm). [website](https://www.google.com/makani/). [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makani_Power).  
* Ampyx Power. Founded in 2008. Developing a hard wing, sailplane line, kite with ground based generator. Total investment of at least 4.5 million euro [reference](https://www.ampyxpower.com/partners). [website](https://www.ampyxpower.com).
