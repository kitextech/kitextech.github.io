Another advantages of the kite system is that it can more easily capture wind at higher altitudes where the wind is more consistent, delivering a given power output with less downtime. This will become especially important as a larger proportion of the locally generated energy is from non-constant sources such as wind and solar power.

Furthermore, since the bending moment on the foundation of a kite mill is small to non-existent it is much easier to install kite based systems in offshore conditions.
