# Critical Questions

## Do you have some calculations to show dual kites are better than one?
The benefits from sharing the tether between two kites follow quite natural once the important design parameters of kite energy system has been determined. It first appeared in the very first patent about high altitude wind energy in 1976 (1) and was described as the so-called ‘dancing planes’ concepts.

The efficiency advantages of a dual kite system has been modeled in detail by Mario Zanon, S'ebastien Gros, Joel Andersson and Moritz Diehl (2). With their (mostly reasonable) assumptions a system to generate 3MW would in a dual kite configuration require total surface area of 45 m2 compared to 150 m2 for a single kite system. The advantage of the dual kite system does decrease for very large system.

## What will you do about the patents?
As mentioned above the idea of onboard power generation (even using two kites) has been known since 1976 and the patents covering the general concept has expired.

One potentially challenging patent is the one submitted by Makani Power (now owned by Google) in 2013 (3) describing a energy kite with onboard power generation, which is able to take off and land like a drone using it's generators "in reverse" to provide thrust. We do believe we can adapt our solution to avoid infringing the patent, but some uncertainty still exist. The patent has since been transferred to the US Department of Energy.

It seems especially Google is currently trying their best to protect their investment through obfuscation currently submitting a lot of patents. Historically very few of the thousands of patents within wind engineerings has had any impact (4), (5).

We do recognize the importance of intellectual property and have and advisor to the team with more than 10 years of IP experience and PhD within electromechanics and aerodynamics.


## Doesn't kites use too much space?
The energy production per area is an interesting question. Italian researchers has estimated that a airborne wind energy systems could increase energy production per unit of land by a factor of 5 to 15 times, but it's not very clear how they arrive at those numbers (7). Until further research has been done on the topic we expect output will be in the same order of magnitude. Interestingly enough for traditional windmills they have the same output per area no matter the size [Stiesdal (in Danish) ](https://ing.dk/blog/bliver-vindmoellerne-ved-med-at-vokse-del-ii-192275).

In any case our primary focus is reducing the cost per energy and not power per area.

## What happens during a storm ?
The kite itself will in normal operations be flying at up to speeds 80 m/s, much faster than the average storm speeds. It should be possible to fly in very high wind speeds, but landing it in a controlled manner might be more difficult. So it's most likely preferable to land the kites before the wind speeds gets too high.

Rotoray aircrafts (as helicopters and the kite) are however able to land in quite adverse conditions as shown in this video by the Danish Air Force. [Helicopter landing at rough sea during a storm](https://youtu.be/ptem1zpHD_s)

Traditional wind turbines does in fact also shut down in case of stormy weather (25 m/s typically) to protect them from damage.

## What about Lightning strikes?
Kites will be susceptible to lightning and would need to be protected in a similar fashion to general aviation airplanes. By making the body conducting and isolating the critical electronics sufficiently is possible to lead the current around the critical components.

## Surely icing conditions must be a problem?
Over icing of the kite would be quite problematic as it could lead to a loss of control. Icing is however also a problem for traditional wind turbines as it leads to less efficient airfoils and results reduced power output. The most well tested solution is to install an electric heating system in the blades to keep the surface temperature above zero. Given the amount of heat needed to be dissipated from the electrical converters in a airborne generator (kite) it's not unlikely there could be some kind of synergy.

## The cost of Solar energy is falling exponentially!?
Whether solar or wind is the better option mostly depends on the amount of wind and sun available on a given site. If solar cells continue to drop in price and this will mean that the balance point will move, however it seems both technologies will be relevant. 

## Will the system be robust enough to be economical?
This is perhaps the most critical questions of all. Even though modern wind turbines are also very complex machines a kite wind turbine would potentially be a order of magnitude worse. Especially a dual kite system will be susceptible to mechanical failures.

There is nothing pointing towards it being impossible, but the questions is at what R&D cost. On the positive side, most components will be much smaller and much cheaper than equivalent wind turbine versions, making component replacement much cheaper.

## Isn't it quite dangerous?
In the foreseeable future these kite system will mainly be operated in very sparsely populate areas (desserts, offshore) so the risk on injuring anyone should be very low. With time as confidence and operating hours increase it's not unlikely that the kite turbines could be used on/over farm land.

## Won't the kite be too heavy with the generators onboard?
While slightly counterintuitive to most, the weight of the kite (of a system with onboard generators) does not impact the power generated (as a first order approximation) (6). However while in hovering mode the mass constraint is a serious concern and a large mass would also cause undesirable large variations in energy production of the single kite doing one turn.

This is one of the challenging aspects of the project as the serious weight restrictions means components needs to be carefully selected and designed. On the positive side Multi-rotor (Drone) systems seems to constantly grow in size these days and Makani has already shown that they can hover a 600 kW kite (video)[https://vimeo.com/141280416] in 2015.    

## Will aviation authorities allow kite wind mills?
Ampyx power (Netherlands), Kitemill (Norway) and Makani (USA) has been all allowed to setup test with commercial size tether lengths. It seems there is a willingness from the aviation agencies to be cooperative in finding solutions.   

## How long time will it take to develop?
With a Elon Musk timeline the kite would be producing energy mega watts by 2020, realistically add a year or two.

## What will be the R&D cost
In order to get to a commercially viable system some industry estimates are in the order of 100 M USD, which doesn't seems unreasonable, but possibly more. Development cost of the last iteration of the giant offshore wind turbines (by Siemens and Vestas) are in the order of 500 M USD.
