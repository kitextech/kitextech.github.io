# Airborne wind energy literature - january 2018

This is the current KiteX literature list. We hope that it might help new entrants to the Airbone wind energy field. It should be possible to find the paper/resource based on the title mentioned. First a few especially interesting papers.


### Literature review
Compared to the literature review *Cherubini, Antonello, et al. "Airborne Wind Energy Systems: A review of the technologies." Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 51 (2015): 1461-1476.* Then this list also contains secondary literature like general flight control and general wind energy/off grid market information ect.

### Getting started
For anyone getting started we would recommend reading *Diehl, Moritz. "Airborne wind energy: Basic concepts and physical foundations." Airborne wind energy. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2013. 3-22.*

### Onboard generation
If you are paticular interested in onboard generation then you will find *Kolar, Johann W., et al. "Conceptualization and multiobjective optimization of the electric system of an airborne wind turbine." IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics 1.2 (2013): 73-103.* to be an excellent start. Also try to find articles by Florian Bauer on the topic of power trains.

### Meta study
You can find the most significant contributions to the AWE scene in this meta study *Mendonça, Anny Key de Souza, et al. "Comparing Patent and Scientific Literature in Airborne Wind Energy." Sustainability 9.6 (2017): 915.*. The amount of AWE patents has now reached 238 and the (proceeding and article) count has reached 199.
