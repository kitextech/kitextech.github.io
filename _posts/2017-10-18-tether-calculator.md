# Airborne Wind Energy Tether Designer
The Tether is one of the most critical components of the airborne wind energy system. The requirements are

1. Large tensile loads
2. Flexible enough to be wound up
3. Transfer considerable power
4. Aerodynamic
5. Low mass
6. Low maintenance

This combination is unique to airbone wind energy and therefore the tethers the tethers has to be developed specifically for this task. Base on previous work, then we have made a interactive designer using analytical expressions and an iterative approach solves for an optimal design.

## Inspiration / Sources
Based on the method described in appendix A of F. Bauer, R. M. Kennel: “Fault Tolerant Power Electronic System for Drag Power Kites”. Submitted to “Journal of Renewable Energy” (Hindawi), 2017. PREPRINT [Bauer research (link to a PREPRINT PDF)](http://www.eal.ei.tum.de/research/projects/research-bauer/)

## Source code
The source code is available at [github.com/kitextech/tetherDesigner](https://github.com/kitextech/tetherDesigner). It's published under MIT License. We want to encourage collaboration on the development of airborne wind energy.
