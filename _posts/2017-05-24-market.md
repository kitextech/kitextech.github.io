# Market
We have identified 3 very interesting markets for our KiteX turbines.


## Small Industry, Resorts and Remote communities
Wind turbine systems using 100 kW turbines are usually very expensive ( about € 5 per watt ) since only a few turbines is put up together and you still need to bring in heavy civil works construction equipment to build the foundation and raise the turbine. The kiteX only cost about € 1.2 per watt installed greatly reducing cost.

Normally these systems are sold to larger factories that seek a greener profile, resorts, and communities in remote areas where the current price can be competitive against Diesel.

This is a very interesting market interesting given how much cheaper KiteX system is, however it could take years to solve general regulations and safety concern for widespread adoption.

Energy off-grid is today almost solely generated using diesel generators. Most of the cost of the energy is the cost of diesel itself. Typical energy prices in remote areas can be as high as 0.5 USD per kWh. The price of energy for the kite system (in windy places) is around 0.2 USD per kWh. Assuming a 30% capacity factor the return of investment on our 100 kW kites could be as low as 1.5 years. This still leaves room for a 100% profit margin on our devices.

## Remote land areas and decommissioned offshore turbines.
For a 1 MW system we see two main uses.
The first offshore wind farm was build in 1991 and has just recently been decommissioned. Given a expected lifetime of the turbines of about 25 years we will see an growing number of offshore wind farms being decommissioned over the coming year - and for eternity... Given that the foundation and grid connection is already in place it will in many cases make sense to install the cheapest possible turbine for the rated infrastructure capacity. This is a superb initial marked as the infrastructure is already in place reducing the up cost and risk involved in the project. Given that it's offshore it should be fairly easy to close off the area for leisure sailing.

Further  The 1MW kites are cheaper than conventional turbines for onshore deployment. Initially larger remote areas for wind farms are a very promising market. China has a short term goal of a installed capacity of 210 GW in 2020, but has enormous on shore potential of 2000 GW wind capacity. Most of this resource is located on the Tibetan plateau which is sparsely populated. That's a potential of 2,000,000 of our 1 MW kites. Other interesting areas include Southern Chile and Australia.

## Offshore wind farms.
The foundation for offshore kite turbine will always be significantly cheaper than a comparable one for a similar sized traditional turbine. In offshore situations the initial cost of the foundation and platform is rather large so increasing the size will greatly reduce the total cost per watt. For that reason it will make sense to develop a larger sized kite of 5MW to reduce the relative foundation/anchoring cost. The most promising marked for these kites will initially be deep offshore waters where they are not competing with traditional turbines and the profit can be higher.
