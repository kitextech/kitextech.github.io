# Market
We have identified 3 very interesting markets for our KiteX turbines.

## Small Industry, Resorts and Remote communities
Wind turbine systems using 100 kW turbines are usually very expensive (about €5 per watt capacity) since only a few turbines are put up together and you still need to bring in heavy civil works construction equipment to build the foundation and raise the turbine. For comparison, the KiteX systems cost about €1.2 per watt installed.

Normally these systems are sold to larger factories that seek a greener profile, resorts and communities in remote areas where the price of diesel is very high.

This is a very interesting market since the competing technologies, diesel and small wind turbines, are very expensive. The main drawback is that time and effort need to be invested in clarifying regulations to make kite energy possible, in each jurisdiction. We therefore plan to initially target jurisdictions and geographies that have already been through this process for traditional wind energy.

Energy for off-grid and micro-grid use today is almost solely produced using diesel generators. Most of the cost of the energy comes from the cost of the diesel fuel, the generator being comparatively cheap. Typical energy prices in remote areas can be as high as 0.50 USD per kWh. The price of energy for the kite system (in windy places) is around 0.20 USD per kWh, assuming we sell the systems for $250,000 and the cost is (very conservatively) amortised over only 5 years.

Assuming a 30% capacity factor the investment in the kite system will be paid back in as short as 1.5 years, while still providing KiteX with a healthy 50% gross margin. This also shows that a business model where KiteX essentially sells energy could be extremely profitable, while of course requiring significant capital.

## Remote land areas and decommissioned offshore turbines.
For a 1 MW system we see two main uses.
The first offshore wind farm was built in 1991 and has just recently been decommissioned. Given an expected lifetime of the turbines of about 25 years we will see an growing number of offshore wind farms being decommissioned over the coming years - and this will only increase over time. Given that the foundations and grid connections are already in place it will in many cases make sense to install the cheapest possible turbine for the rated infrastructure capacity. This is a superb initial market for KiteX as the infrastructure is already in place, reducing the installation cost and risk involved in the project.

Further, the 1MW kites are significantly cheaper than conventional turbines for onshore deployment. Initially large wind farms in remote areas are a very promising market. China has a short term goal of an installed capacity of 210 GW in 2020, but has an enormous onshore potential of 2000 GW wind capacity. Most of this wind resource is to be found on the Tibetan plateau, which is very sparsely populated. Other interesting areas include Southern Chile and Australia.

## Offshore wind farms.
The foundation for an offshore kite turbine will always be significantly cheaper than a comparable  traditional turbine. In offshore situations the initial cost of the foundation and platform is rather large so increasing the size will greatly reduce the total cost per watt. For that reason it will make sense to develop a larger sized kite of 5MW to reduce the relative cost of foundation and anchoring. The most promising market for these kites will initially be deep offshore waters where they are not competing with traditional turbines at all and the profit can be higher.
