# Kite Energy Simulator
We have developed a kite energy simulator that's able to model the physics of a airborne kite energy system. It's useful for the development of new kite designs and to test out new control algorithms. Also it's the first simulator that's able to run in a browser, which means it can be run [instantly (link)](/kitesim) on almost any computer.

## Inspiration / Sources
Especially the tether model is inspired by the method used in [FreeKiteSim](https://bitbucket.org/ufechner/freekitesim). It's also described in the paper *Fechner, Uwe, et al. "Dynamic model of a pumping kite power system." Renewable Energy 83 (2015): 705-716.* [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6218)

For the **flight controller** we decided to implement a quaternion based attitude controller which is quite close to the approach described in *Fresk, Emil, and George Nikolakopoulos. "Full quaternion based attitude control for a quadrotor." Control Conference (ECC), 2013 European. IEEE, 2013.* [link](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1010947/FULLTEXT01.pdf)

### Airfoil data

The simulation includes a 360 degree lift and drag function for the **DU 96-W-180** wind turbine airfoil. *Timmer, W. A. "Aerodynamic characteristics of wind turbine blade airfoils at high angles-of-attack." 3rd EWEA Conference-Torque 2010: The Science of making Torque from Wind, Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 28-30 June 2010. European Wind Energy Association, 2010.*

Further in includes a 180 degree lift and drag functions for the **NACA 0012** symmetric airfoil. *Sheldahl, Robert E., and Paul C. Klimas. Aerodynamic characteristics of seven symmetrical airfoil sections through 180-degree angle of attack for use in aerodynamic analysis of vertical axis wind turbines. No. SAND-80-2114. Sandia National Labs., Albuquerque, NM (USA), 1981.*[link](https://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/6548367)

The data has been extracted from figures from above articles.

## Source code
The source code is available at [github.com/kitextech/kitesim](https://github.com/kitextech/kitesim). It's published under GNU General Public License v3.0. We want to encourage collaboration on the development of kite energy simulation codes. Major code refactoring should be expected.

## Modes
The current simulation includes 3 different flight modes: Hovering, Transition and PathFollowing.
